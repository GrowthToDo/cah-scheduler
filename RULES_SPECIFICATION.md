---

## 3. Hard Rules (Must Not Be Violated)

Hard rules are constraints that **cannot be broken**. The scheduler will not create assignments that violate these rules.

### 3.1 Minimum Staff Per Shift
- **Rule:** Each shift must meet the minimum staff count defined by either:
  - The shift definition's required staff count, OR
  - The census band requirements (if census is set)
- **Applies to:** All shifts where `countsTowardStaffing = true`

### 3.2 Charge Nurse Required
- **Rule:** If a shift requires a charge nurse, at least one assigned staff member must be marked as charge nurse for that shift, must have `isChargeNurseQualified = true`, and must have `icuCompetencyLevel ≥ 4`
- **Competency requirement:**
  - **Level 5** is the preferred (primary) charge nurse
  - **Level 4** may serve as stand-in charge nurse only when no Level 5 is available on the same shift
  - **Levels 1–3** can never be assigned as charge, even if `isChargeNurseQualified` is set in the database (the flag alone is not sufficient)
- **Applies to:** Shifts marked as `requiresChargeNurse = true`

### 3.3 Patient-to-Licensed-Staff Ratio
- **Rule:** The ratio of patients to licensed staff (RN + LPN combined) must not exceed the census band limit
- **Example:** If census band says 2:1 ratio and there are 8 patients, you need at least 4 licensed staff (RNs + LPNs)
- **Note:** CNAs do not count toward this ratio

### 3.4 Minimum Rest Between Shifts
- **Rule:** Staff must have at least **10 hours** of rest between the end of one shift and the start of the next
- **Purpose:** Prevents fatigue and ensures safety
- **Configurable:** Yes, default is 10 hours

### 3.5 Maximum Consecutive Days
- **Rule:** Staff cannot work more than **5 consecutive days** without a day off
- **Configurable:** Yes, default is 5 days

### 3.6 ICU Competency Minimum
- **Rule:** Staff assigned to ICU must have a minimum competency level of **2**
- **Purpose:** Level 1 staff cannot work ICU independently

### 3.7 Level 1 Preceptor Required *(NEW)*
- **Rule:** Any Level 1 (Novice/Orientee) staff member scheduled for a shift must have a Level 5 (Expert/Preceptor) staff member also assigned to the **same shift**
- **Purpose:** Orientees must always have a preceptor present

### 3.8 Level 2 ICU/ER Supervision Required *(NEW)*
- **Rule:** Level 2 (Advanced Beginner) staff working in **ICU or ER** must have at least one Level 4 or Level 5 staff member on the same shift
- **Purpose:** Advanced beginners need supervision in critical care areas
- **Applies to units:** ICU, ER, ED, Emergency (exact word match on unit name)
- **Note:** Unit matching uses word-boundary comparison, not substring matching. A unit named "Med-Surg" does **not** trigger this rule — "MED-SURG" must contain one of the supervised unit names as a complete word (e.g., "ICU", "ER", "ED", "EMERGENCY"). This prevents false positives on units whose names happen to contain supervised unit abbreviations as substrings.

### 3.9 No Overlapping Shifts *(NEW)*
- **Rule:** A staff member cannot be assigned to two shifts that overlap in time
- **Example:** Cannot be assigned to Day shift (07:00-19:00) and Evening shift (13:00-01:00) on the same day

### 3.10 PRN Availability *(NEW)*
- **Rule:** Per Diem (PRN) staff can **only** be scheduled on days they have marked as available
- **Process:** PRN staff submit their availability for each schedule period (6 weeks out)
- **Note:** If a PRN staff member has not submitted availability, they cannot be scheduled

### 3.11 Staff On Leave *(NEW)*
- **Rule:** Staff with **approved leave** cannot be scheduled during their leave period
- **Leave Types:** Vacation, Sick, Maternity, Medical, Personal, Bereavement, Other
- **Note:** Only approved leave blocks scheduling; pending leave requests do not

### 3.12 On-Call Limits *(NEW)*
- **Rule:** Staff cannot exceed on-call limits:
  - Maximum **1 on-call shift per week** (configurable)
  - Maximum **1 on-call weekend per month** (configurable)
- **Purpose:** Prevents burnout from excessive on-call duty

### 3.13 Maximum 60 Hours in 7 Days *(NEW)*
- **Rule:** Staff cannot work more than **60 hours** in any rolling 7-day period
- **Calculation:** The system checks **all 7 rolling windows that contain the candidate shift date** — not just the backward-looking window — to correctly account for shifts already assigned on future dates. This is important because the scheduler processes the most-constrained shifts first, which may place future-dated assignments before earlier-dated ones are processed.
- **Purpose:** Safety limit to prevent extreme fatigue

---

## 4. Soft Rules (Preferences & Penalties)

Soft rules are **preferences** that the scheduler tries to optimize. Violations incur penalty scores, and the scheduler tries to minimize total penalties. These can be overridden by managers when necessary.

### 4.1 Overtime & Extra Hours *(UPDATED)*
**Previous Logic (Incorrect):** Any hours over (FTE × 40) counted as overtime; violation was attached staff-level (not to a specific shift)

**Current Logic:**
| Scenario | Penalty Level | Example |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| Hours > 40 in a week | **HIGH** penalty (actual overtime) | A 1.0 FTE nurse working 44 hours = 4 hours OT |
| Hours > (FTE × 40) but ≤ 40 | **LOW** penalty (extra hours, not OT) | A 0.9 FTE nurse (36 standard hours) working 40 hours = 4 extra hours but NOT overtime |

**Exemption:** Staff with **FTE = 0** (Agency / on-demand) are **fully exempt** from this rule. They have no weekly hours commitment, so no "standard" or "overtime" threshold applies to them.

**Violation Attribution:** The violation is emitted on the **specific shift that crosses the threshold**, not retroactively on all of that staff member's shifts. Assignments before the threshold are clean; only the triggering shift is flagged. This makes the penalty actionable — swapping or removing that one shift eliminates the violation.

**Rationale:** It's better to pay staff extra shift premium than overtime rates or agency rates.

**Penalty Weights:**
- Actual OT (>40h): Weight = 1.0 (normalized so 12 hours OT = 1.0 penalty)
- Extra hours (≤40h): Weight = 0.3

### 4.2 Weekend Shifts Required *(UPDATED)*
- **Rule:** Each staff member must work a minimum number of weekend shifts per schedule period
- **Default:** 3 weekend shifts per 6-week schedule
- **Configurable:** Yes, per unit
- **Exemption:** Staff marked as "Weekend Exempt" are excluded

**How violations are raised (current logic):**
The rule flags assignments **beyond** the required count — i.e., excess weekend shifts — rather than flagging a shortfall. Assignments up to the required count are accepted without penalty. Each assignment beyond that limit generates one violation, attached to that specific shift. This means:
- The violation appears on the exact shift that is "one too many", making it easy to identify which assignment to remove or swap
- A staff member with exactly the required number of weekend shifts has zero violations — they are meeting the target
- A staff member with fewer than the required count has no violation either; shortfall is handled through the scheduler's optimisation pressure (preferring to assign that person on weekends when possible), not through explicit penalties

**Penalty per excess shift:** 0.5 per weekend shift beyond the required count

### 4.3 Consecutive Weekends Penalty *(NEW)*
- **Rule:** Penalize staff who work more than the maximum consecutive weekends
- **Default Maximum:** 2 consecutive weekends
- **Penalty:** Applied per extra consecutive weekend (0.8 per weekend over the limit)
- **Purpose:** Ensures weekends are distributed fairly over time
- **Weekend definition:** Saturday and Sunday of the same calendar weekend count as **one weekend**, not two. Working both days of the same weekend does not increment the consecutive weekend counter twice.

### 4.4 Holiday Fairness *(UPDATED)*
- **Rule:** Holiday shifts should be distributed fairly among staff **annually** (not per schedule period)
- **Tracking:** System maintains `staff_holiday_assignment` table to track yearly holiday assignments
- **Holiday Grouping:** Certain holidays are grouped together as one:
  - **Christmas:** Christmas Eve and Christmas Day count as ONE "Christmas" holiday. Working either day counts as "worked Christmas."
- **Penalties:**
  - Staff below yearly average: Penalty proportional to shortfall
  - Staff significantly above yearly average: Small penalty
- **Holidays Tracked:** New Year's Day, MLK Day, Presidents' Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas (Eve + Day combined)

### 4.5 Staff Preference Match
- **Rule:** Try to match staff to their preferred shifts and days
- **Preferences Tracked:**
  - Preferred shift type (Day, Night, Evening, Any)
  - Max hours per week
  - Max consecutive days
  - Preferred days off
  - Preferred pattern (e.g., "3on-4off", "4on-3off")
- **Penalty:** Applied when assignments don't match preferences

### 4.6 Float Penalty *(NEW)*
- **Rule:** Minimize floating staff to units other than their home unit
- **Penalty Levels:**
  | Scenario | Penalty |
  |----------|---------|
  | Float to unit where staff IS cross-trained | Low (0.3) |
  | Float to unit where staff is NOT cross-trained | High (1.0) |
- **Purpose:** Staff prefer working in familiar environments; cross-training makes floating less disruptive

### 4.7 Charge Nurse Distribution *(NEW)*
- **Rule:** Prevent too many charge-qualified nurses from clustering on the same shift
- **Logic:**
  1. Calculate average charge-qualified nurses per shift
  2. If a shift exceeds (average + 1), apply penalty
  3. Minimum threshold of 2
- **Purpose:** Keep charge nurses distributed so there's backup coverage across shifts

### 4.8 Skill Mix Diversity
- **Rule:** Each shift should have a mix of experience levels
- **Purpose:** Avoid having all senior or all junior staff on one shift
- **Penalty:** Applied when skill mix is unbalanced

---

## 5. Unit Configuration Options

Each unit (ICU, ER, Med-Surg, etc.) can have its own configuration:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Weekend Rule Type** | "count_per_period" or "alternate_weekends" | count_per_period |
| **Weekend Shifts Required** | Number of weekend shifts required per schedule period | 3 |
| **Schedule Period Weeks** | Length of scheduling period in weeks | 6 |
| **Holiday Shifts Required** | Minimum holiday shifts per period | 1 |
| **Max Consecutive Weekends** | Maximum consecutive weekends before penalty | 2 |
| **Escalation Sequence** | Order to try when filling callouts | Float → Per Diem → Overtime → Agency |
| **Acuity Yellow Extra Staff** | Additional staff needed at Yellow acuity | 1 |
| **Acuity Red Extra Staff** | Additional staff needed at Red acuity | 2 |
| **Low Census Order** | Order to send home during low census | Voluntary → Overtime → Per Diem → Full Time |
| **Callout Threshold Days** | Days before shift to classify as callout vs open shift | 7 |
| **OT Approval Threshold** | Hours of OT requiring CNO approval | 4 |
| **Max On-Call Per Week** | Maximum on-call shifts per week | 1 |
| **Max On-Call Weekends Per Month** | Maximum on-call weekends per month | 1 |

---

## 6. Census Bands & Staffing

Census bands define staffing requirements based on patient count:

### Example: ICU Census Bands
| Band Name | Patients | Required RNs | Required LPNs | Required CNAs | Charge Nurses | Ratio |
|-----------|----------|--------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| Low Census | 1-3 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2:1 |
| Normal Census | 4-6 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2:1 |
| High Census | 7-9 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2:1 |
| Critical Census | 10-12 | 4 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 1:1 |

**Note:** Patient-to-nurse ratio is calculated using **licensed staff (RN + LPN)**, not just RNs.

---

## 7. Escalation & Coverage Workflow

The system handles coverage needs differently based on timing:

### 7.1 Callouts (Urgent - Within 7 Days)

When a staff member calls out or leave is approved within the callout threshold (default: 7 days), the system creates a **Callout** record. The manager follows the escalation sequence manually.

**Default Escalation Sequence:**
1. **Float Pool** - Check if float staff are available
2. **Per Diem (PRN)** - Contact available per diem staff
3. **Overtime** - Offer overtime to regular staff
4. **Agency** - Call agency as last resort

**Callout Reasons Tracked:**
- Sick
- Family Emergency
- Personal
- No Show
- Other

**Callout Statuses:**
- **Open** - Not yet filled
- **Filled** - Replacement found
- **Unfilled Approved** - Approved to run short-staffed

### 7.2 Coverage Requests (Advance Notice - Beyond 7 Days) *(NEW in v1.2.1)*

When leave is approved more than 7 days before the shift, the system **automatically finds replacement candidates** and presents them for manager approval.

**Automatic Candidate Finding Process:**
1. System searches for available staff following the escalation ladder
2. For each potential candidate, the system checks:
   - Availability (not on leave, not already assigned)
   - Qualifications (unit, competency level)
   - Hours worked this week (overtime check)
   - Rest requirements (10-hour minimum)
   - 60-hour weekly limit
3. Top 3 candidates are ranked and presented with reasons

**Candidate Ranking Criteria:**
| Source | Priority Score | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Float Pool | Highest (100+) | Designed for coverage |
| PRN (Available) | High (80+) | Marked date as available |
| Regular Staff (OT) | Medium (60+) | Overtime may apply |
| Agency | Lowest (10) | External, highest cost |

**Within each source, candidates are ranked by:**
- Unit qualification (home unit > cross-trained)
- Competency level (higher = better)
- Reliability rating (1-5 scale)
- Flex hours YTD (lower = fairer distribution)

**Reasons Provided for Each Candidate:**
Each candidate recommendation includes explanatory reasons such as:
- "Float pool staff - designed for coverage"
- "Cross-trained for ICU"
- "PRN staff - marked available for this date"
- "High reliability rating (5/5)"
- "No overtime (within 40 hours)"
- "Low flex hours YTD (fair distribution)"

**Coverage Request Statuses:**
- **Pending Approval** - Waiting for manager to select a candidate
- **Approved** - Manager approved, assignment created
- **Filled** - Assignment confirmed and active
- **Cancelled** - Request cancelled
- **No Candidates** - No suitable candidates found (manual intervention needed)

---

## 8. Low Census Policy

When census drops and staff need to be sent home, follow this order:

### Default Low Census Order:
1. **Voluntary (VTO)** - Staff who have indicated willingness to go home (Voluntary Time Off)
2. **Overtime** - Send home staff on OT
3. **Per Diem** - Send home PRN staff
4. **Full Time** - Send home full-time staff (rotated fairly based on Flex Hours YTD)

**Note:** Agency staff are not included in the low census order because agency contracts typically guarantee minimum hours. Sending agency home may still incur costs.

### Voluntary Time Off (VTO):
- Staff can indicate they are "Available for VTO" via the Staff page
- These staff are prioritized first when low census requires sending people home
- VTO is voluntary and based on staff preference
- VTO indicator can be toggled on/off by staff or managers

### Flex Tracking:
- System tracks flex hours year-to-date per staff member
- Used to ensure fair rotation of who gets sent home
- Staff with fewer flex hours YTD are more likely to be flexed next
- Within each category (VTO, OT, PRN, FT), staff are sorted by flex hours YTD (lowest first)

---

## 9. Assignment Attributes

Each assignment (staff → shift) tracks:

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Is Charge Nurse** | Whether this person is charge for this shift |
| **Is Overtime** | Whether this assignment is overtime |
| **Assignment Source** | How the assignment was created: Manual, Auto-Generated, Swap, Callout Replacement, Float, Agency Manual, Pull Back |
| **Is Float** | Whether staff is working outside their home unit |
| **Float From Unit** | Original unit if floating |
| **Safe Harbor Invoked** | If nurse accepted assignment under protest (Texas law) |
| **Agency Reason** | For agency: Callout, Acuity Spike, or Vacancy |
| **Status** | Assigned, Confirmed, Called Out, Swapped, Cancelled, Flexed |

---

## 10. Special Features

### 10.1 Shift Swap Requests
- Staff can request to swap shifts with each other
- Swaps require manager approval
- System validates that swap doesn't violate hard rules

### 10.2 Safe Harbor (Texas Law)
- Nurses can accept an assignment "under protest" if they feel it's unsafe
- This is tracked for legal/compliance purposes
- Links to a Safe Harbor form ID

### 10.3 Sitters
- Each shift can specify number of 1:1 sitters needed
- Sitters add to CNA requirements

## Changelog

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| 1.0 | Feb 2026 | Initial document with all rules and configuration options |
| 1.1 | Feb 13, 2026 | Added Section 11 (Application UI Guide) documenting all available pages: Leave Management, Shift Swaps, PRN Availability, Unit Configuration, and Holidays Management |
| 1.2 | Feb 15, 2026 | **Major updates based on expert feedback:** (1) Holiday fairness now tracks annually, Christmas Eve/Day merged as one holiday; (2) Low census order updated - removed Agency, added Voluntary Time Off (VTO); (3) Added Coverage page for managing shifts needing coverage; (4) Leave approval now auto-creates coverage requests for affected assignments; (5) Staff page now shows clickable calendar view for each staff member; (6) Added callout threshold days configuration |
| 1.2.1 | Feb 15, 2026 | **Coverage auto-fill workflow:** Leave approval (> 7 days) now automatically finds top 3 replacement candidates instead of creating manual open shifts. Each candidate includes reasons (e.g., "Cross-trained for ICU", "High reliability"). Manager reviews and approves, assignment is auto-created. Renamed "Open Shifts" to "Coverage" in navigation. |
| 1.2.2 | Feb 16, 2026 | **Census & Preferences visibility:** (1) Census input added to shift assignment dialog - determines required staffing via census bands; (2) Staff count display fixed to show scheduled/required based on census; (3) Staff detail dialog now shows shift preferences; (4) Census Bands added to Excel import/export |
| 1.2.3 | Feb 18, 2026 | **Staff preferences in Excel:** Staff preferences can now be imported/exported via Excel. New columns in Staff sheet: Preferred Shift, Preferred Days Off, Max Consecutive Days, Max Hours Per Week, Avoid Weekends |
| 1.3.0 | Feb 20, 2026 | **Section 12 added:** Scheduling Algorithm — describes greedy construction, local search, three weight profiles, hard rule eligibility, soft penalty scoring, understaffing handling, and audit behavior for automated schedule generation |
| 1.4.0 | Feb 20, 2026 | **Charge nurse competency (§1.3, §3.2):** Level 4+ is now a hard requirement for charge nurse assignment. Level 5 is the preferred primary charge; Level 4 is stand-in only. `isChargeNurseQualified` flag alone is insufficient for levels 1–3. **60h rolling window (§3.13):** System now checks all 7 windows containing the shift date, not just the backward-looking window, to catch violations caused by future shifts assigned earlier in the greedy pass. |
| 1.4.2 | Feb 20, 2026 | **Overtime rule (§4.1):** Violations now attach to the specific shift that crosses the threshold, not staff-level. Agency/on-demand staff with FTE = 0 are exempt. **Weekend rule (§4.2):** Logic flipped from flagging shortfall to flagging excess assignments beyond the required count; each excess assignment is flagged with a shift-specific violation. Both changes make the violations panel actionable — each flagged shift shows exactly which assignment to review. |
| 1.4.3 | Feb 22, 2026 | **Balanced OT weight (§12.5):** Raised from 1.0 to 1.5 so actual overtime is consistently more expensive than any single preference violation, matching the real 1.5× payroll cost. **Capacity-spreading bonus (§12.4):** Small incentive added to prefer less-loaded staff as a tiebreaker, reducing overtime accumulation on regular staff and preserving float pool capacity. |
| 1.4.4 | Feb 22, 2026 | **Assignment dialog charge validation (§3.2):** `needsCharge` condition now requires Level 4+ (not just any `isChargeNurse` flag). "Assign as Charge" button is gated to Level 4+ nurses. Assigning a new charge nurse demotes any previous charge on the same shift so the hard violation resolves immediately. |
| 1.4.5 | Feb 22, 2026 | **Charge protection guard (§12.2):** Look-ahead added to greedy Pass 2 — Level 4+ nurses are protected from regular slots when they are the sole remaining charge candidate for an upcoming ICU/ER shift within 7 days. Eliminates Sunday hard violations in the FAIR schedule caused by the low overtime weight exhausting charge nurses. **PRN availability (§3.10):** Lookup broadened to aggregate across all schedule submissions; standing availability is honoured by any new schedule covering the same dates. **Cost-Optimized float weight (§12.5):** Corrected 3.0 → 2.0 to reflect that float differentials cost less than overtime. |
| 1.4.6 | Feb 22, 2026 | **Agency penalty added (§12.4, §12.5):** New `agency` weight component applies a flat penalty whenever an agency nurse is considered for a slot. Ensures the scheduler exhausts regular, float, and PRN pools before drawing on agency (markup 2–3× base pay). Weights: Balanced 2.5, Fairness-Optimized 1.5, Cost-Optimized 5.0. **PRN Available Days column in Excel (§3.10):** Import template and export now include a "PRN Available Days" column for per_diem staff. Accepted formats: comma-separated day abbreviations (e.g. "Mon, Wed, Fri"), "Weekdays", "Weekends", or "All". Importing this column auto-creates `prn_availability` records spanning the next 12 months — PRN staff are immediately usable in auto-generated schedules without a manual availability submission step. |
| 1.4.7 | Feb 22, 2026 | **Weekend ICU charge shifts prioritised first in greedy (§12.2):** Weekend charge slots (Sat/Sun) were previously sorted after all weekday charge slots (earliest date first within priority 1). In the FAIR profile — where the low overtime weight allows charge nurses to accumulate hours freely Mon–Fri — this meant weekend slots arrived last with the charge pool already near its 60h rolling limit. Splitting priority 1 into weekend-ICU-charge (new priority 1) and weekday-ICU-charge (priority 2) ensures Sat/Sun charge shifts get first pick of Level 4+ nurses before any weekday shift has consumed their capacity. Applies to all three schedule variants; Balanced and Cost-Optimized are unaffected in practice because their higher overtime penalties already prevent charge-pool depletion. |
| 1.4.3 | Feb 22, 2026 | **Scheduler penalty re-calibration (§12.4, §12.5):** (1) Balanced variant `overtime` weight raised from 1.0 → 1.5, making actual OT (a real 1.5× payroll cost) consistently more expensive than any single preference violation. (2) Capacity-spreading bonus added to the scoring function: a small incentive (−`overtime_weight × 0.1 × remaining_hours/40`) prefers staff with more remaining hours before the 40h threshold. Acts as a tiebreaker that naturally spreads assignments across the week, reduces temporal depletion of float pool capacity, and decreases unnecessary overtime on regular unit staff. |

## 12. Scheduling Algorithm

The CAH Scheduler includes an **automated scheduling engine** that generates a full schedule from scratch for a given schedule period. The engine runs from the **Generate Schedule** button on any schedule detail page and produces three independent schedule variants in the background.

---

### 12.1 Overview

| Variant | Description | Disposition |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Balanced** | Equal weight across all objectives | Written directly to the schedule's assignment table as the active draft |
| **Fairness-Optimized** | Prioritises weekend equity, holiday fairness, and preference matching | Saved as an alternative scenario |
| **Cost-Optimized** | Minimises overtime and float/agency use | Saved as an alternative scenario |

Each variant is generated **fully independently** using the same two-phase algorithm with different penalty weight profiles. Managers compare variants on the Scenarios page and click **Apply** to switch the active schedule.

> **Note:** Generating a new schedule wipes all existing assignments for that schedule and starts fresh.

---

### 12.2 Algorithm — Three Phases

#### Phase 1: Greedy Construction

Shifts are sorted by **constraint difficulty** (most constrained first, to maximise the chance of filling hard-to-fill slots before the candidate pool is depleted):

1. **Weekend ICU/ER charge shifts** (Saturday or Sunday) — most constrained. In a weekly cycle, weekend charge slots fall at the end of date-ordered processing, so charge-qualified nurses accumulate hours Mon–Fri before the slot is reached. Processing them first guarantees they get first pick of the Level 4+ charge pool.
2. Weekday ICU/ER shifts that require a charge nurse
3. All other ICU/ER shifts
4. Night shifts
5. Day and evening shifts
6. On-call shifts (most flexible candidate pool, filled last)

Within each group, earlier dates come first, then earlier start times.

For each shift:
1. If a **charge nurse slot** is required and not yet filled, a charge-qualified candidate is selected first.
2. Remaining **staff slots** are filled one at a time.
3. For each slot: filter all active staff through the **hard rule eligibility checks** (see §12.3) and the **charge protection guard** (see below). The eligible pool is then split into **non-OT candidates** (weekly hours + this shift ≤ 40h) and **OT candidates** (would cross 40h). Non-OT candidates are used exclusively when any exist; OT candidates are only considered when every eligible nurse would cause overtime. Within whichever pool is used, candidates are ranked by the **soft penalty function** (see §12.4) and the lowest-penalty candidate is assigned.
4. If no eligible candidate exists for a slot, the slot is left empty. The shift is recorded as **understaffed** with the most common hard rule rejection reasons.

**Charge protection guard (Pass 2):** Before including a Level 4+ charge-qualified nurse as a candidate for a regular (non-charge) slot, the algorithm checks whether assigning them now would exhaust their 60-hour rolling-window capacity for any upcoming ICU/ER charge shift within the next 7 days. The nurse is excluded from the current slot only if: (a) they would be rendered ineligible for the upcoming charge shift by this assignment, **and** (b) no other Level 4+ nurse is still eligible for that upcoming charge shift. This prevents the FAIR profile's low overtime weight from over-consuming charge nurses on regular slots, leaving Sunday ICU charge shifts with no valid candidate.

#### Phase 1.5: Hard Violation Repair

After greedy construction, the schedule is scanned for remaining hard violations:

- **Missing charge nurse** — shift requires a charge nurse but none was assigned
- **Missing Level 4+ ICU supervisor** — ICU/ER shift has staff but no Level 4+ nurse
- **Understaffed slots** — fewer staff assigned than the minimum required

Shifts are repaired in criticality order (ICU charge first, then non-ICU charge, then ICU general, then others). For each violation, two strategies are tried:

1. **Direct assignment** — find any eligible staff member not yet on the violated shift and assign them. This succeeds when the greedy's charge-protection guard held back a nurse who is actually available.

2. **Swap repair** — move a Level 4+ nurse from a *lower-criticality* shift to the critical slot. The mechanism: removing the nurse from their current assignment changes which rolling 7-day windows contain their hours, potentially dropping their total below the 60-hour cap for the critical shift. The vacated slot is then back-filled with any eligible generalist nurse so the donor shift does not stay short-staffed.

A donor shift is only raided when:
- Its criticality is strictly lower than the violated shift (e.g., a regular day shift can donate to an ICU charge shift)
- It retains at least one staff member after the raid
- Its own charge nurse is not removed (unless another charge nurse remains)
- An ICU donor shift with Level 2 nurses is not left without Level 4+ supervision

Up to three repair passes are run so cascading fixes take effect (e.g., adding Level 4+ makes Level 2 staff newly eligible, filling the next pass's shortfall).

A violation is preserved in the output **only when no eligible candidate exists anywhere** in the staff roster — a genuine shortage that requires management intervention (contacting agency, finding additional staff).

#### Phase 2: Local Search (Swap Improvement)

Up to 500 random swap attempts are made between pairs of assignments on different shifts. A swap is accepted only if:
- Both staff members pass all hard rules in their swapped positions
- The total soft penalty of the schedule decreases

This monotonic hill-climbing approach escapes greedy local optima without ever violating hard rules.

### 12.3 Hard Rule Eligibility Checks

These are evaluated in the order shown. Failing any check immediately disqualifies the candidate for that shift — they are **never relaxed**.

| # | Check | Details |
|---|-------|---------|
| 1 | **Approved leave** | Staff on approved leave for the shift date cannot be assigned |
| 2 | **PRN availability** | Per-diem (PRN) staff must have submitted availability for this date |
| 3 | **ICU/ER competency** | Shifts in ICU, ER, or ED units require `icuCompetencyLevel ≥ 2` |
| 4 | **No overlapping shifts** | Staff cannot be on two shifts whose time windows overlap |
| 5 | **Minimum rest (10 hours)** | At least 10 hours must separate the end of the previous shift and the start of this one |
| 6 | **Max consecutive days (5)** | Cannot create a run of more than 5 consecutive working days. Reduced to a staff member's personal preference if that preference is lower. |
| 7 | **60-hour rolling window** | Adding this shift must not push total hours in any 7-day window above 60h |
| 8 | **On-call limits** | On-call shifts respect `maxOnCallPerWeek` and `maxOnCallWeekendsPerMonth` unit settings |

If **all** remaining candidates fail hard rules for a given slot, that slot is left unfilled. The shift is flagged as understaffed with a summary of the most common rejection reasons, surfaced to the manager after generation.

---

### 12.4 Soft Rule Penalty Scoring

Each eligible candidate receives a penalty score. Lower is better. Negative values are valid (used to incentivise assignments that improve fairness or skill mix). The candidate with the **lowest penalty** is selected.

Each component is multiplied by the weight for that component in the active variant's weight profile.

| Component | Incentive / Penalty | Condition |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Overtime — heavy** | + `weight × (OT hours / 12)` | Total weekly hours would exceed 40 |
| **Overtime — light** | + `weight × 0.3 × (extra hours / 12)` | Total would exceed FTE target but not 40h |
| **Capacity bonus** | − `weight × 0.1 × (remaining hours before 40h / 40)` | Always applied; highest for staff at 0h, zero for staff already at 40h |
| **Shift type mismatch** | + `weight × 0.5` | Candidate prefers a different shift type |
| **Preferred day off** | + `weight × 0.7` | Shift falls on a day the staff prefers off |
| **Weekend avoidance** | + `weight × 0.6` | Shift is on Sat/Sun and staff has `avoidWeekends = true` |
| **Weekend incentive** | − `weight × 0.5` | Shift is a weekend shift and staff is below their required weekend count |
| **Float — uncross-trained** | + `weight × 1.0` | Assigned outside home unit, not cross-trained there |
| **Float — cross-trained** | + `weight × 0.3` | Assigned outside home unit, but cross-trained |
| **Skill mix — all same** | + `weight × 0.6` | All staff on shift (including candidate) would share the same competency level |
| **Skill mix — partial dup** | + `weight × 0.1` | Candidate's competency level already exists on shift, but mix is not uniform |
| **Preceptor incentive** | − `weight × 0.8` | Candidate is Level 5 and a Level 1 is already on the shift |
| **Level 2 supervision** | − `weight × 0.6` | Candidate is Level 4+ on an ICU/ER shift that has a Level 2 nurse |
| **Charge clustering** | + `weight × 0.5` | Non-charge-candidate is charge-qualified, but shift already has a charge nurse |
| **Agency** | + `weight × 1.0` | Candidate is an agency nurse (employment type = `agency`) |

**Capacity bonus rationale:** Mirrors natural charge-nurse behaviour — when two candidates are otherwise equal, the one with more remaining hours this week is asked first. The coefficient (0.1) is intentionally small so it acts as a tiebreaker only and does not override meaningful clinical penalties (skill mix, charge requirement, preferences). Float pool staff — who have no home-unit bias and often have lower accumulated hours when critical ICU shifts are scheduled first — benefit most from this bonus, naturally reducing overtime on regular unit staff later in the schedule.

### 12.5 Weight Profiles

Three profiles are defined. Weights are multiplied by the per-component penalty constants above.

| Weight | Balanced | Fairness-Optimized | Cost-Optimized |
|--------|----------|--------------------|----------------|
| `overtime` | **1.5** | 0.5 | **3.0** |
| `preference` | **1.5** | **2.0** | 0.5 |
| `weekendCount` | 1.0 | **3.0** | 1.0 |
| `consecutiveWeekends` | 1.0 | **3.0** | 1.0 |
| `holidayFairness` | 1.0 | **3.0** | 1.0 |
| `skillMix` | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.5 |
| `float` | 1.0 | 0.5 | **2.0** |
| `chargeClustering` | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.5 |
| `agency` | **2.5** | 1.5 | **5.0** |

**Balanced overtime rationale:** Raised from 1.0 → 1.5 so that actual overtime (a real payroll cost at 1.5× pay) is consistently more expensive than any single preference violation. At 1.5, 8h OT costs 1.0 scheduler units vs. a shift-type mismatch at 0.75 — overtime takes priority. The Fairness-Optimized profile intentionally keeps overtime low (0.5) because it accepts some extra hours in exchange for a more equitable weekend/holiday distribution.

**Cost-Optimized float rationale:** Lowered from 3.0 → 2.0. Float differentials are a flat hourly add-on (typically \$3–5/hr), not a multiplier, so they cost less than overtime (1.5× base pay). Setting float equal to overtime (both 3.0) overstated the cost of cross-unit assignments. The corrected weight (2.0) still strongly discourages unnecessary floating of regular-unit nurses while remaining below the overtime penalty.

**Agency weight rationale:** Agency nurses carry a 2–3× markup over base pay (agency fee + premium rate), making them significantly more expensive than even overtime (1.5× base) or float differentials. The `agency` penalty is a flat addition applied to every agency nurse in the candidate pool, ensuring the scheduler exhausts regular employees, float pool, and PRN staff before drawing on agency coverage. Cost-Optimized uses the highest agency penalty (5.0) to aggressively reserve agency as a true last resort. Fairness-Optimized uses a lower penalty (1.5) so equitable distribution across all staff takes precedence over cost avoidance. Agency staff retain all hard rule constraints — they are not scheduled in violation of rest, competency, or leave rules just because they are last resort.

---

### 12.6 Understaffing

When the greedy phase cannot fill a slot, the repair phase (§12.2 Phase 1.5) immediately attempts to fix it by swapping specialised staff from lower-priority shifts. A shift only remains understaffed after generation when **both** the greedy phase and the repair phase have exhausted all possibilities.

For shifts that still cannot be filled after repair:
- The slot is left **empty** — hard rules are never relaxed
- The shift is recorded with: date, shift type, unit, slots required, slots filled, and rejection reason
- After generation, warnings are shown to the manager
- The manager must resolve these manually (assign staff individually, contact an agency, etc.)

Understaffed shifts reported after generation represent **genuine staffing shortages** — the roster does not have enough eligible staff to cover them, regardless of how the schedule is arranged.

---

### 12.7 Audit Trail

| Event | # Entries | Action | Details |
|-------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Schedule auto-generated | 3 (one per variant) | `schedule_auto_generated` | Variant type, assignment count, understaffed count, full score breakdown |
| Scenario applied | 1 | `scenario_applied` | Scenario name, old assignment count, new assignment count |
| Subsequent manual changes | Per-event | Existing behavior | Callouts, swaps, manual assignments continue to produce individual audit entries |

The `assignmentSource` field on each assignment record distinguishes how the assignment was created:
- `auto_generated` — created by the scheduling algorithm (Balanced variant)
- `scenario_applied` — created when a manager applied an alternative scenario
- `manual` — created by a manager through the assignment dialog
