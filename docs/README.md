# CAH Scheduler Documentation

## About CAH Scheduler

CAH Scheduler is a staff scheduling application designed for **Critical Access Hospitals (CAH)** - small rural hospitals that serve communities far from large medical centers. These hospitals have unique challenges:

- Small staff pools (can't just call in extra people)
- Staff who wear multiple hats
- 24/7 coverage requirements
- Strict regulatory compliance
- Limited budgets

This application helps nurse managers create fair, compliant, and cost-effective schedules while keeping staff happy and patients safe.

### Key Features

- **Auto-generate schedules** — Click "Generate Schedule" on any schedule and the system builds a full roster from scratch in seconds. Three variants are produced automatically: Balanced, Fairness-Optimized, and Cost-Optimized.
- **Hard rule enforcement** — Constraints like rest hours, 60-hour weekly limits, competency requirements, and approved leave are *never* violated. If a shift can't be filled, it is flagged as understaffed rather than silently breaking a rule.
- **Charge nurse rules** — Only Level 5 nurses (or Level 4 as a stand-in when no Level 5 is available) can be assigned as charge nurse. A Level 2 or Level 3 nurse cannot hold a charge role regardless of how their record is configured.
- **Violations dashboard** — After generating or editing a schedule, the page shows a full breakdown of hard violations (must fix) and soft violations (schedule quality), with a per-staff view so you know exactly who is affected and why.
- **Scenario comparison** — The two alternative variants are saved as scenarios you can review and apply at any time without regenerating.
