## About CAH Scheduler

CAH Scheduler is a staff scheduling application designed for **Critical Access Hospitals (CAH)** - small rural hospitals that serve communities far from large medical centers. These hospitals have unique challenges:

- Small staff pools (can't just call in extra people)
- Staff who wear multiple hats
- 24/7 coverage requirements
- Strict regulatory compliance
- Limited budgets

This application helps nurse managers create fair, compliant, and cost-effective schedules while keeping staff happy and patients safe.
