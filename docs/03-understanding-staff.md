## The People Behind the Schedule

Before we can schedule anyone, we need to understand who we're scheduling. In healthcare, staff aren't interchangeable - each person has specific qualifications, skills, and constraints.

---

## Staff Roles

### Registered Nurse (RN)

**What they do:** RNs are the backbone of patient care. They:
- Assess patients and create care plans
- Administer medications (including IV drugs)
- Coordinate with doctors
- Supervise other nursing staff

**Why it matters for scheduling:**
- Most shifts require a minimum number of RNs
- Only RNs can do certain tasks (like IV medications)
- Patient-to-nurse ratios are often RN-specific

### Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN)

**What they do:** LPNs work under RN supervision:
- Basic patient care
- Some medications (varies by state)
- Vital signs and monitoring
- Patient comfort

**Why it matters for scheduling:**
- LPNs cannot replace RNs for staffing calculations
- Combined with RNs for "licensed staff" ratios
- More limited scope than RNs

### Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA)

**What they do:** CNAs provide hands-on basic care:
- Bathing and dressing patients
- Feeding assistance
- Moving patients
- Taking vital signs

**Why it matters for scheduling:**
- CNAs don't count toward nurse staffing ratios
- But they're essential for patient care
- High census = need more CNAs

## Employment Types

Not all staff work the same way. Understanding employment types is crucial for scheduling.

### Full-Time Staff

**What it means:**
- Committed to ~40 hours per week (1.0 FTE)
- Regular, predictable schedule
- Benefits (health insurance, PTO, etc.)

**Scheduling implications:**
- Expected to work their hours each week
- Subject to weekend and holiday requirements
- Get first priority for preferred shifts

### Part-Time Staff

**What it means:**
- Works less than 40 hours/week
- Example: 0.5 FTE = 20 hours/week
- May or may not get benefits

**Scheduling implications:**
- Pro-rated requirements (0.5 FTE = half the weekend requirement)
- More flexibility in scheduling
- May pick up extra shifts when available

### Per Diem / PRN Staff

**PRN** = "pro re nata" (Latin for "as needed")

**What it means:**
- No guaranteed hours
- Works when needed AND available
- Often paid higher hourly rate (but no benefits)

**Scheduling implications:**
- **Must submit availability** - the scheduler can only use them on days they've said they're available
- Cannot be forced to work
- Great for filling gaps, but unreliable for core coverage

**Example:**
> Sarah is a PRN nurse. For the February schedule, she submits that she's available on Feb 3, 7, 12, 15, and 20. The scheduler can only place her on those specific days.

### Float Pool Staff

**What it means:**
- Not assigned to a specific unit
- "Floats" to wherever they're needed
- Cross-trained in multiple areas

**Scheduling implications:**
- Can fill gaps in any unit they're trained for
- First call for coverage when someone calls out
- May have less preference for specific unit culture

### Agency Staff

**What it means:**
- Not hospital employees
- Hired through external staffing agencies
- Temporary, contract workers

**Scheduling implications:**
- **Most expensive option** - often 2-3x the cost of regular staff
- Used as last resort
- No long-term commitment to the hospital
- Sent home first if census drops (low census policy)

## Competency Levels (ICU Specific)

In critical care areas like the ICU, not all nurses are equal. The system tracks **competency levels** from 1-5:

### Level 1: Novice/Orientee

**Who they are:**
- Brand new hires
- Still in orientation/training period
- Learning the unit

**What they can do:**
- Learn and observe
- Take patients WITH supervision

**Scheduling rules:**
- ⚠️ **Cannot work alone** - must always have a Level 5 preceptor on the same shift
- Don't count toward staffing numbers (FTE contribution = 0)

### Level 2: Advanced Beginner

**Who they are:**
- Finished orientation
- Can handle stable, routine patients
- Still gaining experience

**What they can do:**
- Take Med-Surg or Swing Bed patients independently
- Work with stable patients in monitored settings

**Scheduling rules:**
- ⚠️ **Cannot work ICU/ER alone** - must have Level 4+ supervisor on same shift
- Can work independently in less acute areas

### Level 3: Competent (Standard)

**Who they are:**
- Fully trained, independent nurses
- Can handle standard patient load
- Typically ACLS/PALS certified

**What they can do:**
- Work independently in any area they're trained
- Handle standard ICU/ER patients
- Respond to routine emergencies

**Scheduling rules:**
- Can work independently
- Full contributor to staffing counts

### Level 4: Proficient (Trauma Ready)

**Who they are:**
- Experienced nurses
- TNCC (trauma) certified
- Can handle high-acuity situations

**What they can do:**
- Handle codes and trauma alone until backup arrives
- Supervise Level 2 staff
- Take the sickest patients

**Scheduling rules:**
- Can supervise Level 2 staff in ICU/ER
- Valuable for high-acuity shifts

### Level 5: Expert (Charge/Preceptor)

**Who they are:**
- Most experienced nurses on the unit
- Can run the entire shift
- Trusted to train new staff

**What they can do:**
- Serve as Charge Nurse
- Precept (train) Level 1 orientees
- Take the most complex patients
- Make unit-wide decisions

**Scheduling rules:**
- ✅ Required when Level 1 staff are scheduled
- ✅ Can serve as Charge Nurse
- High priority for coverage

## Special Staff Attributes

### Charge Nurse Qualified

**What it means:** This person can be the "Charge Nurse" for a shift.

**What a Charge Nurse does:**
- Oversees the entire shift
- Makes patient assignments
- Handles problems and escalations
- Coordinates with doctors and management

**Scheduling rule:** Most shifts require at least one charge-qualified nurse present.

### Weekend Exempt

**What it means:** This person is exempt from weekend requirements.

**Why would someone be exempt?**
- ADA accommodation (disability)
- Religious observance
- Negotiated contract terms
- Other HR-approved reasons

**Important:** Only administrators can set this flag. Regular managers cannot exempt themselves or favorites from weekends.

### Certifications

Nurses may have special certifications:

| Certification | What It Is |
|---------------|------------|
| **ACLS** | Advanced Cardiac Life Support - can run heart emergency codes |
| **PALS** | Pediatric Advanced Life Support - can handle child emergencies |
| **BLS** | Basic Life Support - standard CPR (usually required for all) |
| **TNCC** | Trauma Nursing Core Course - trauma specialist |

Certain assignments may require specific certifications.

## FTE: Full-Time Equivalent

**FTE** is how we measure expected work hours.

| FTE | Hours/Week | What It Means |
|-----|------------|---------------|
| 1.0 | 40 hours | Full-time |
| 0.9 | 36 hours | Nearly full-time (common for 3x12 schedules) |
| 0.8 | 32 hours | 4 days per week |
| 0.5 | 20 hours | Half-time |
| 0.0 | 0 hours | PRN (no guaranteed hours) |

**Why it matters:**
- FTE determines expected hours per schedule
- Weekend requirements are pro-rated by FTE
- Working beyond your FTE may incur overtime

**Example:**
> John is 0.9 FTE. In a normal week, he should work 36 hours.
> If he works 40 hours, he worked 4 "extra" hours (but not overtime until >40).
> If he works 44 hours, he has 4 hours of actual overtime.

## Home Unit & Cross-Training

### Home Unit

Every staff member has a "home unit" - where they normally work.

**Example:** Maria's home unit is the ICU.

### Cross-Training

Some staff are trained to work in multiple units.

**Example:** Maria is also cross-trained for the ER.

**Why this matters for scheduling:**
- If the ER is short and ICU is overstaffed, Maria can "float" to the ER
- Floating to a cross-trained unit is preferred over floating to an untrained unit
- The scheduler tracks this for optimal coverage

---

## The Staff Lifecycle

Here's how a new nurse progresses in the system:

```
Day 1: Hired
├── Employment Type: Full-Time (1.0 FTE)
├── Role: RN
├── Home Unit: ICU
├── Competency Level: 1 (Orientee)
└── Status: In orientation, paired with preceptor

Week 8: Completes Orientation
├── Competency Level: 2 (Advanced Beginner)
└── Status: Can work independently in Med-Surg, supervised in ICU

Month 6: Gains Experience
├── Competency Level: 3 (Competent)
├── Certifications: ACLS obtained
└── Status: Fully independent in ICU

Year 2: Becomes Proficient
├── Competency Level: 4 (Proficient)
├── Certifications: TNCC obtained
└── Status: Can supervise others, trauma ready

Year 5: Expert Status
├── Competency Level: 5 (Expert)
├── Charge Nurse Qualified: Yes
└── Status: Can run the unit, train new hires
```

## Summary

Understanding staff is the foundation of scheduling:

1. **Roles** (RN, LPN, CNA) determine what tasks they can do
2. **Employment types** determine hours, flexibility, and cost
3. **Competency levels** determine supervision requirements
4. **Certifications** enable specific assignments
5. **FTE** determines expected work hours
6. **Home unit & cross-training** determine where they can work

The scheduler uses all of this information to:
- Place the right people on the right shifts
- Ensure proper supervision
- Balance the workload fairly
- Minimize costs
